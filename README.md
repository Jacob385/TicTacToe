## Design Choices
With the design choice, we kept polymorphism in mind to reduce the amount of duplicate code in the project. 

## Contribution

When it comes to who did what, Jacob created the initial App, MyO, MyX, Tile, and Grid. Meanwhile, Jesse modified those classes and created a BlankTile class which can be found in the RegTicTacToe.
